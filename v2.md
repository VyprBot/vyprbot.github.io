# Update Info

I know it may not look a whole lot different, but currently running on [VyprBot's Account](https://www.twitch.tv/vyprbot) is VyprBot v2.

For short, v2 is a complete rewrite of VyprBot. The interaction side of things is 90% the same, but the code side of things is completely overhauled.

---

# Why did you rewrite it?

The main reason that I rewrote this bot is because I wanted to clean up the code. Before, I had one index.js file. This file had over 2.3k lines of code in it, and was starting to get very crowded and filled. Having modules is a much better approach. This bot is also now written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for my own sanity.

# To Note...

If you find a bug with VyprBot, or it goes offline for a while, ***please for the love of god, "vb suggest" it.*** IT'S NOT GONNA FIX ITSELF

# Bad News

The bad news of this update is on the user data side of things. Because I'm a lazy fuck, I use [Replit's Database](https://docs.replit.com/hosting/database-faq). This means that the database used in VyprBot v2 is completely seperate from VyprBot v1. For me, this is not a big deal, for others, it is.

When you try to use any commands like "vb weather" and "vb covid", you'll now get an error saying that your data isn't there. This is because all user data has been completely wiped. You must set all of your preferences again using the "vb set" command.

# Can I get my data transfered?

Yes! Currently, the only data I'm going to move over is the nammers. For all of the other commands, you will need to set those. ***If you would like your nammers transfered from v1 to v2, USE THE "VB SUGGEST" COMMAND!!!!!*** I promise you, I will get to your suggestion. Example: "vb suggest nammers migration" <-- ***THIS IS ALL YOU NEED TO DO***
